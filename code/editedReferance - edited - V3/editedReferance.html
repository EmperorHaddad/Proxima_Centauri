I have found it impossible to insert a image that does so in squence with the 
other code instead of after so i taken this code and cutting it down to a 
usable sub-routine for in inserting images onto a canvas.

V1: 
- remove some code and simplify other in the 'component' class.
- changed how the startGame() sub-routine is called.
- remove some code in the 'updateGameArea' sub-routine.
- removed buttons.
- removed functions linked to buttons.
- removed text.

V2: 
- remove some code in the 'myGameArea' variable.
- removed some 'this' keywords in the 'component' class.
- attempted to dismantle 'myGameArea' var - FAILED

- came to to conclusion that adding images (without delay) only works 
when using the iterative sub-routine '.setInterval'
- it wasn't...

- made JS use an existing canvas instead of generating one itself
- swapped colours in CSS
- replaced 'smilely.gif' with 'grid.png'.

V3:
- moved CSS to a saperated file.
- attempted to JS code to another file.
- replaced CSS code with my CSS code.
- removed the last parameter of the 'component' class as it was now redundant.
- removed the 'newPos' method of the 'component' class as it was now redundant.
- replaced 'this.image' with 'image' in the 'component' class.
- successfully dismantled the 'myGameArea' var.
- updateGameArea
- created 'initialiseCanvas' sub-routine.

- it appears that 'setInterval' in-built sub-routine is essential for the image
to appear.

- I am now going to attempt to integrate the JS code inside of my own JS code 
in 'webgame - V,A,3,1'.
